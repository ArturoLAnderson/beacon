Beacon is a decentralized instant messaging software. The underlying communication is based on NKN, Libp2p and other peer-to-peer communication systems. It can realize point-to-point direct communication between users. Data is stored and forwarded without third-party servers. It has important features such as security and privacy protection.

In addition to peer-to-peer user communications, users can also set up their own groups. Group communication also implements important functions such as offline messaging.

Currently only supports mac os, windows operating system.

Future versions will integrate crypto currency wallets and applets. Allows direct transfer of friends to the chat window, as well as allowing the applet to call the wallet interface to implement a financial-related applet application scenario.
